# Uncontinued narrative-mystery game.

This project was intended to become a narrative-driven mystery game.
Project was developed with Unity 2022.3.62f2
I've laid some groundwork:
- Player movement and controls
- Multiple editable camera positions
- Interactable objects in the environment
- A dialogue system implemented using Ink

Mostly developed from scratch in a period of a month.
